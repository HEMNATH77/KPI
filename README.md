# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Using Power BI

## Project Description
This repository provides a Power BI-based solution for creating, tracking, and visualizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of various business processes. The project leverages Power BI’s rich visualization capabilities to create dynamic and interactive dashboards, enabling stakeholders to monitor critical metrics in real-time.

KPIs are essential in any business to track performance against targets, and this project demonstrates how to effectively utilize Power BI for this purpose, offering detailed insights into your data.

## Features & Functionalities

- **Dynamic KPI Dashboards**: Create visually engaging dashboards that display real-time performance of business metrics.
- **Data Integration**: Import data from various sources like Excel, SQL databases, SharePoint, or APIs.
- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Utilize Power BI’s automatic data refresh capabilities to get up-to-date insights.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Build customized visuals like gauge charts, bar charts, and trend lines for a better representation of KPIs.
- **Filters & Slicers**: Enable users to filter KPIs based on time periods, departments, or other relevant attributes.
- **KPI Indicators**: Define performance thresholds (such as target vs actual) to indicate performance status (e.g., green, yellow, red).
- **Interactive Drill-through**: Allow users to drill down into specific KPI data to analyze the root cause of any performance issue.
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Publish reports to Power BI Service and share them with teams or embed them into websites or apps.

# Process

### 1. Load the Data
- Open Power BI Desktop.
- Import the sample data provided in the `data/` folder using the following steps:
  - Go to **Home** → **Get Data** → **Excel** (or another data source type).
  - Choose the appropriate data files (e.g., `sales_data.xlsx`, `employee_performance.csv`).
  - Load the data into Power BI for further analysis.

### 2. Build KPIs & Dashboards
- Open the `.pbix` files located in the `reports/` folder.
- You can modify the KPIs, change the visuals, and adjust filters as per your business needs.

### 3. Publish to Power BI Service (Optional)
- Once your dashboard is ready, you can publish it to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.
  - Go to **File** → **Publish** → **To Power BI**.
  - Sign in to your Power BI account and publish the report to your workspace.

## Example KPIs

Here are some example KPIs that can be tracked using Power BI in this project:

### 1. **Sales Revenue**
   - **Definition**: The total income generated from sales of products or services.
   - **Formula**: `SUM(Sales[Revenue])`
   - **Target**: $1,000,000 per month
   - **Visualization**: Line Chart showing revenue over time.

### 2. **Customer Retention Rate**
   - **Definition**: Percentage of customers who continue to make purchases over a period.
   - **Formula**: `COUNT(Customers[RepeatPurchases]) / COUNT(Customers[TotalCustomers]) * 100`
   - **Target**: 90%
   - **Visualization**: Gauge chart displaying the retention rate.

### 3. **Employee Productivity**
   - **Definition**: Measures the output per employee over a period.
   - **Formula**: `SUM(EmployeePerformance[Output]) / COUNT(EmployeePerformance[EmployeeID])`
   - **Target**: 150 units per employee per month
   - **Visualization**: Bar chart with employee performance comparison.

### 4. **Website Conversion Rate**
   - **Definition**: Percentage of website visitors who complete a desired action (e.g., making a purchase, signing up).
   - **Formula**: `COUNT(Conversions[CompletedActions]) / COUNT(WebsiteTraffic[Visitors]) * 100`
   - **Target**: 5%
   - **Visualization**: KPI card showing the conversion rate with conditional formatting (Green/Yellow/Red).

## Usage

### 1. Creating a KPI Indicator in Power BI
- **Step 1**: Import data related to the KPI.
- **Step 2**: Create a measure or calculation for the KPI (e.g., sales, conversion rate, etc.).
- **Step 3**: Add the KPI visualization by selecting the **KPI** visual in Power BI.
- **Step 4**: Set the target and actual values for the KPI.
- **Step 5**: Customize the visual to include conditional formatting, thresholds, and status indicators (e.g., Green, Yellow, Red).
  
### 2. Interactivity and Filtering
- **Step 1**: Use slicers to filter data by time, department, region, or product category.
- **Step 2**: Add drill-through functionality to allow users to drill into detailed data from the main KPI visual.
- **Step 3**: Make the report interactive so users can explore different aspects of the KPIs.
